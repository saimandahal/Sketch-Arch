   The fullparameter training mode starts on GPUs, and after satisfying the initial convergence and statistical tests, we obtain the pretrained model (Θ) and create a LoRA model (Θ′). Further,the training is done on lower-parameter training mode in heterogeneous manycore architecture, providing a fully-trained model.
