## Sketch-Arch
Sketch-Arch, an energy-efficient architecture for real-time mapping of long read sequences in portable systems. We present an implementation that targets the proposed PNM architecture, and also a GPU-friendly implementation for baseline comparisons. The implementations use a structured hash-map and can leverage at least two different types of 𝑘-mer sampling methods (minimizers and syncmers) under the hood.
